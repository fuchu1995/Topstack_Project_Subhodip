About Dataset
Context
This dataset offers a comprehensive overview of global electricity production data spanning 48 countries from 2010 to 2023. It provides valuable insights into the balance, production, and values of electricity generation across different regions over the specified timeframe. With its focus on electricity production, this dataset is instrumental for energy analysts, policymakers, and researchers aiming to understand global energy trends, identify patterns, and develop strategies for sustainable energy production and consumption.

Content
Containing essential columns such as country name, date, balance, product, value, and unit, this dataset enables thorough analyses of electricity production dynamics. Researchers can explore the temporal trends in electricity generation, assess the distribution of production across countries, and investigate the impacts of various factors on energy production. By examining the balance between different energy sources, understanding production trends, and analyzing the variation in production values, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding energy policies, infrastructure investments, and renewable energy adoption strategies.
